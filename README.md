## Setup project

1. Download the _Visual Studio_ version of OpenFrameworks form [this link](https://openframeworks.cc/download/) 
2. Extract the archive `of_vX.X.X_vs_release` on your computer
3. Go to `of_vX.X.X_vs_release/apps/myApps` and create a directory for this repository - This step is extremely important or else the library files will be missing and the project won't be working
