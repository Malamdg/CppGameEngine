## Setting up the project

1. Download the _Visual Studio_ version of OpenFrameworks form [this link](https://openframeworks.cc/download/) 
2. Extract the archive `of_vX.X.X_vs_release` on your computer
3. Go to `of_vX.X.X_vs_release/apps/myApps` 
4. Create a directory to clone the repository in
5. Clone the repo and make sure that its root is the directory you just created.\
If not move **ALL** the files to have the `src` dir situated as such: `of_vX.X.X_vs_release/apps/myApps/myDir/src`
6. Enjoy

note that the `myApps` dir is not the only solution you have, you can put your project directory in any sub-directory of `apps`
